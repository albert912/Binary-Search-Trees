Pseudocode for buildTree(array)

(Write a buildTree(array) function that takes an array of data (e.g., [1, 7, 4, 23, 8, 9, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 67, 6345, 324]) and turns it into a balanced binary tree full of Node objects appropriately placed (donâ€™t forget to sort and remove duplicates!). The buildTree function should return the level-0 root node.)
